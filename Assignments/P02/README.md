## Program 2 - Baby Steps
### Ethan Bailey
### Description:

This program draws a rectangle on an existing image "mustangs.jpg" and creates a new file from it.
It does this through Go's version of a class using structs and methods to create an instance,
edit the image, and save to file.

### Files

| :---: | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | main.go          | Main driver that calls the imageManipulator function.        |
|   2   | imageManipulator.go        | File that contains the imageManipulator package and function. |
|   3   | go.mod   | Base go file that defines the module's module path |
